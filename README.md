<b>Hello 👋</b><br>
I’m C0mput3r5c13nt15t, well actually I want to become one. For now I'm just a student.
<br><br>
<b>My interests 👀</b><br>
I'm pretty much interested in everything that has to do with computer science, but my focus lies on:
- Web development (Fullstack)
- Web design
- Theoretical stuff (Algorithms, Maths, etc.)
- Programming languages (especially esoteric ones)


<br><b>My current projects 🌱</b><br>
- Building a Saas application
- Developping an algorithm for the Capacitated House Allocation Problem
- and much more!

<br><b>Collaborations 💞️</b><br>
I'm not really planning on collaborating on anything, but I'm open for it!
