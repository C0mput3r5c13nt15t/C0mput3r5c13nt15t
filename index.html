                When gazing into the sky, there's one thing, or rather several things, that are very hard to miss - the clouds. They come in all imaginable shapes and sizes and when looking at them most people cannot help but interpret the clouds as all sorts of objects, be it cars, ships, animals or even people. One thing that might not come to one's mind however is the question of how that would look from space, but that is exactly the question we want to set out to answer in our Astro Pi project. The one obvious caveat is that we cannot go for ourselves, so we want to train an AI to do the job for us. But with that one in a lifetime chance to get footage directly from the ISS, it would be a shame to limit oneself to just recognizing funny shapes in the clouds.

              <h4>Art Gallery</h4>
              <p>
                This is a small digital art gallery I made for my local school for a parents weekend. Please note that the site was created in an extremely short amount of time and is therefore not fully developed but rather a kind of prototype.
